# ⏱️ React Native Timer App

A simple and beautiful multi-timer app built with **React Native**. You can create timers by duration, organize them by categories, track progress, and get notified when they complete — even in the background (Android only).

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⏳ Create custom timers (with hours, minutes, seconds)
- 📂 Group timers into categories (Work, Study, Exercise, Break, Other)
- ▶️ Start, ⏸️ Pause, 🔄 Reset individual or grouped timers
- 📜 View history of completed timers
- 🔔 Local notifications on completion (via Notifee)
- 💾 Timers auto-save and persist across sessions
- 🌗 Works in background on Android

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrijeshkChaubey/Temers.git
cd Temers
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Temers
It is app which is use to create use customized timers
=======
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.



## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
